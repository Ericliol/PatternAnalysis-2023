# brain MRI super-resolution network


## Introduction of the problem

The aim of this model is to provide a high resolution version of the input brain MRI images. The model used in the task is called ESPCN (Efficient Sub-Pixel CNN), is a model that reconstructs a high-resolution version of an image given a low-resolution version. It involves using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and specifically a sub-pixel convolution layer to upscale low-resolution images to a higher resolution. 

## dataset
The dataset comprises 21,520 brain MRI images and is categorized into AD (Alzheimer's Disease) and NC (Normal Control). The dataset is divided into two subsets: the training dataset, which encompasses 80% of the images, and the validation dataset, which encompasses the remaining 20% of the images. Test data is also loaded. To run this file, `relative_train_path` and `relative_test_path` will need to be altered to fit the data folder path.
