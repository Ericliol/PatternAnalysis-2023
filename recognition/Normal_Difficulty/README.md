# brain MRI super-resolution network


## Introduction of the problem

The aim of this model is to provide a high resolution version of the input brain MRI images. The model used in the task is called ESPCN (Efficient Sub-Pixel CNN), is a model that reconstructs a high-resolution version of an image given a low-resolution version. It involves using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and specifically a sub-pixel convolution layer to upscale low-resolution images to a higher resolution.
